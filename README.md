# Mine Vision
The aim of this project is by using real time computer vision to recognize certain block
do all the necessary steps to get there and mine these blocks automatically.

Example: Recognize the white trees and chop them.

## Where the project is at righ now
Using opencv algorithms, the program is able to match a template and return the click points for each iteration of matches.
For the video capture function I believe it only works on linux specially ubuntu since thatâ€™s what I use in my machine.

* Added hsv filter module
* Working on vision training feature (checkout creation branch)

## Problems to be solved
* Video capture may only work on linux
